Human-in-the-Loop AB-Business Process Management
## Structure
This repository contains the three main parts of the prototype: The backend, the frontend and the camunda engine.

For more info on the parts of the app, please refer to the READMEs in the sub-folders (`source/backend`, `source/frontend`, `api-tests`...).
We try to incorporate the READMEs at the spots where they are most relevant, in order to not add too much information here.

## Contributing

Whenever you encounter a :beetle: **bug** or have :tada: **feature request**, 
report this via Github issues.

We are happy to receive contributions in the form of **pull requests** via Github.
Feel free to fork the repository, implement your changes and create a merge request to the `master` branch.

### Git Commit Messages

Commits should start with a Capital letter and should be written in present tense (e.g. __:tada: Add cool new feature__ instead of __:tada: Added cool new feature__).
You should also start your commit message with **one** applicable emoji. This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit. Make many but small commits!
